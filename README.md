###The warehouse relied on paper logs and scattered spreadsheets, causing inventory mismatches, pick errors, delayed orders, and zero real-time visibility—making it hard to scale or make timely decisions. 

Goal: Replace the manual workflow with a centralized in-house system that shows live stock levels, auto-generates pick lists, tracks staff assignments, and delivers on-demand reports to cut errors and speed fulfillment. 

###Solution Approach

Ran a needs & gap analysis, mapped current processes with multi-level DFDs, and drafted an ER model.
Applied obligatory/non-obligatory checks and normalized the schema to 4 NF to eliminate redundancy.
Built the design in Microsoft Access—tables, relationships, user forms, and SQL queries/reports for low-stock alerts, pending orders, and picker productivity—yielding real-time inventory updates, automated pick lists, balanced workloads, and faster, more accurate fulfillment
